### <i>Dataset [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks?select=tracks.csv)</i>

## Code

Our main project is in the ```spotify_classification.ipynb``` notebook, also see the ```utils.py``` file (for our utils functions).

## Goal

The goal of this project is to train machine learning models (supervised) that will classified the popularity of a spotify song to three classes:
1. high popular
2. medium popular
3. non popular

## Dataset:

Features:
1. acousticness (Ranges from 0 to 1)
2. artists (List of artists mentioned)
3. danceability (Ranges from 0 to 1)
4. duration_ms (Integer typically ranging from 200k to 300k)
5. energy (Ranges from 0 to 1)
6. explicit (0 = No explicit content, 1 = Explicit content) - Categorical.
7. id (Id of track generated by Spotify) - Numerical.
8. id_artists.
9. instrumentalness (Ranges from 0 to 1).
10. key (All keys on octave encoded as values ranging from 0 to 11, starting on C as 0, C# as 1 and so onâ€¦).
11. liveness (Ranges from 0 to 1).
12. loudness (Float typically ranging from -60 to 0).
13. mode (0 = Minor, 1 = Major).
14. name (Name of the song).
15. popularity (Ranges from 0 to 100).
16. release_date (Date of release mostly in yyyy-mm-dd format, however precision of date may vary).
17. speechiness (Ranges from 0 to 1).
18. tempo (Float typically ranging from 50 to 150).
19. time_signature.
20. valence (Ranges from 0 to 1).

### NOTE: during the ordering of the data we applay the popularity for classification to be in the following format:

| class          | real value   | class value |
|----------------|:------------:|------------:|
| high popular   | 70 <= x      | 2           |
| medium popular | 40 <= x < 70 | 1           |
| non popular    | x < 40       | 0           |

## Models result:

| model                 | accuracy |
|-----------------------|---------:|
| KNeighbors Classifier | 74.20 %  |
| Logistic Regression   | 72.32 %  |
| XGB Classifier        | 77.74 %  |
| MLP Classifier        | 70.82 %  |
